# UX Design Exercises – Hospital Appointment App
## 1. Solution Ideation
Problem: Patients find it difficult to book an appointment quickly in a hospital app because of too many steps and unclear doctor availability.
Crazy 8s (8 Quick Ideas):
1. Quick Doctor Filter – A home screen filter to select “Speciality → Available Now → Nearest Branch” instantly.
2. Voice-based Booking – User can say “Book a dermatologist tomorrow at 10 AM” to schedule.
3. One-Tap Rebooking – A “Rebook Previous Doctor” button for follow-up visits.
4. Smart Suggestions – App recommends doctors based on symptoms entered (“I have fever and cough”).
5. Doctor Availability Calendar – Visual calendar showing free slots with color codes (green = free, red = full).
6. Chat-based Assistant – A chatbot guides user step by step to complete appointment booking.
7. Family Member Profiles – Allows booking for dependents (parents, children) easily from the same account.
8. Emergency Shortcut – A floating button to directly connect to emergency or ambulance booking.
## 2. Creating User Stories
Persona Example: Priya Sharma, 29-year-old working professional who wants to quickly book a doctor’s appointment during her lunch break.

- As a working professional, I want to book an appointment in less than 2 minutes, so that I don’t waste time navigating multiple screens.
- As a parent, I want to book appointments for my child using my account, so that I can manage all medical visits in one place.
- As a patient, I want to see doctor availability in real-time, so that I can choose a convenient slot.
- As a first-time user, I want to get symptom-based suggestions, so that I can find the right specialist easily.
- As a returning user, I want to rebook with the same doctor, so that I can continue my treatment without confusion.
## 3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story: As a working professional, I want to book an appointment in less than 2 minutes, so that I don’t waste time navigating multiple screens.
Scenario Narrative: Priya is a 29-year-old marketing executive who feels sudden tooth pain while at work. It’s her lunch break, and she has only 20 minutes before her next meeting. She opens the hospital app on her phone, hoping to find a dentist available later that evening. The app’s home screen immediately shows a ‘Book Appointment’ button. She taps it and uses filters to select Dentist → Evening Slot → Nearby Branch. The app shows available time slots with doctors’ photos and ratings. Priya feels relieved to see real-time availability and happy when she books the slot within 90 seconds. She receives a confirmation and a reminder notification for 6 PM.
Emotional States: Frustrated (pain), Rushed (time pressure), Relieved (easy booking), Satisfied (confirmation).
Environment: Office during lunch break, mobile device, moderate network connectivity.
